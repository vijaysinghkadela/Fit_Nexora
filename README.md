## 01 — Project Overview

**FitNexora** is a full-stack, multi-tenant SaaS platform that transforms how gym owners manage their business. Unlike traditional gym CRMs, FitNexora embeds a **tiered AI coaching engine** (Claude Opus & Haiku) directly into the platform, providing professional-grade, personalized workout and nutrition plans to every member at scale.

### The Problem
Gym owners in India and emerging markets face a "coaching gap" — they have the space, equipment, and clients, but lack the bandwidth to deliver high-quality, personalized coaching that keeps members retained. Hiring specialist trainers is expensive; generic printed plans don't work.

### The Solution
FitNexora closes this gap by:
- **Automating personalized coaching** via AI trained on the client's goals, injuries, diet, and history
- **Giving owners full business intelligence** — churn prediction, revenue forecasting, peak hour analysis
- **Providing trainers operational tools** — client management, workout assignment, commission tracking
- **Engaging members directly** — a dedicated member app with progress tracking, achievements, and AI chat

---

## 04 — AI Engine

### Tier-Aware Model Router (`claude_service.dart`)

The AI engine uses a smart routing system to balance performance and cost:

```
Request → PlanLimits.canMakeAiCall() → Decision
   ├── Basic:      DENIED (upgrade wall)
   ├── Pro:        → Claude Haiku (fast, cost-efficient)
   └── Elite:
        ├── Within 50 Opus calls → Claude Opus (best reasoning)
        ├── Opus cap exceeded   → Auto-downgrade to Haiku
        └── Overage enabled     → Metered billing ($0.10/call)
```

### Context Injection (`ai_prompt_builder.dart`)

Every AI call is enriched with a **4,000+ token context window** synthesized from:

- 👤 Client profile (age, weight, height, fitness goal, training level)
- 🩺 Medical history (injuries, stress level, health conditions)
- 🍽️ Dietary preferences (10 diet types — Veg, Jain, Keto, IF, etc.)
- 🏋️ Equipment availability (Full gym, home, bodyweight only)
- 🕐 Training schedule (morning / afternoon / evening preference)
- 🥘 Cuisine type & cooking capability (Indian, western, mixed)
- 📍 Regional context (Indian food database, local supplement brands)

### AI Capabilities by Screen

| Module | AI Feature | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Elite Home | Personalized welcome + daily coaching tip | Elite |
| AI Trainer | Full 12-week periodization plan | Elite (Opus) |
| Elite Chat | Live multi-turn AI coaching conversation | Elite |
| Supplements | AI supplement stack recommendations | Pro + Elite |
| Diet Plan | Custom macro-based meal plans | Pro + Elite |
| Progress | AI-driven trend analysis & adjustment | Elite |
| Pro AI Screen | Haiku-based quick coaching suggestions | Pro |
| **AI Agent** | Full body analysis + 4-week workout + diet + monthly report | Elite (Opus) |

---

## 05 — AI Agent (Full Report Pipeline)

The **AI Agent** is a server-side intelligence layer that generates comprehensive member reports by orchestrating multiple Claude API calls in a single pipeline:

### Pipeline Architecture

```
Member ID → Fetch Fitness Profile → Fetch Visit Stats
  → Step 1: Claude Opus → Body Type Analysis (somatotype, BMI, risk flags)
  → Step 2: Claude Opus → 4-Week Progressive Workout Plan  ┐ (parallel)
  → Step 3: Claude Opus → Indian-Context Diet Plan          ┘
  → Step 4: Claude Opus → Monthly Progress Report
  → Save all outputs to Supabase → Display in 4-tab UI
```

### What the Agent Generates

| Module | Output | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Body Analysis** | Somatotype classification | Ectomorph / Mesomorph / Endomorph, BMI interpretation, risk flags, recommended focus |
| **Workout Plan** | 4-week periodized program | Weekly themes, progressive intensity, exercise-level sets/reps/rest, cardio, warm-up/cool-down |
| **Diet Plan** | TDEE-based Indian meal plan | 7 meals/day template, macro targets, supplements, hydration, foods to avoid |
| **Monthly Report** | Executive fitness summary | Attendance verdict, progress rating (1-10), next month priorities, motivational message |

### AI Agent Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/config/ai_agent_prompts.dart` | 4 structured prompt builders (body, workout, diet, report) |
| `lib/services/ai_agent_service.dart` | Claude API orchestrator with rate limiting |
| `lib/models/fitness_profile_model.dart` | Member body metrics and fitness context |
| `lib/models/ai_generated_plan_model.dart` | AI output storage model |
| `lib/providers/ai_agent_provider.dart` | Riverpod state management |
| `lib/screens/master/ai_agent_screen.dart` | 4-tab dashboard (Body / Workout / Diet / Report) |
| `supabase/migrations/019_ai_agent_tables.sql` | Database tables + RLS policies |

### Safeguards

- **Rate limiting** — max 1 report per member per day
- **Plan gating** — only Elite/Master plan gyms can access the AI Agent
- **RLS enforcement** — gym-isolated data at the database level
- **JSON sanitization** — strips markdown fences from Claude responses before parsing

---

## 06 — Database Schema

FitNexora uses **19 PostgreSQL migration modules** on Supabase with full Row-Level Security (RLS) enforcement at the database layer:

### Core Tables

| # | Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gyms` | Master tenant records; each gym is an isolated tenant |
| 2 | `gym_members` | Link table — user → gym with role (`owner`, `trainer`, `client`) |
| 3 | `clients` | Detailed client profiles (injury history, goals, metrics) |
| 4 | `memberships` | Member subscription records (Active, Expired, Paused, Cancelled) |
| 5 | `subscriptions` | Gym-level SaaS plan (Basic / Pro / Elite) + billing data |
| 6 | `ai_usage` | Token and call tracking per tenant for quota enforcement |
| 7 | `gym_checkins` | Real-time traffic logging with `checked_in_at` + `checkout_at` |
| 8 | `food_logs` | Detailed nutrition tracking with macro calculation |
| 9 | `workout_plans` | Versioned, AI-generated workout programs |
| 10 | `diet_plans` | Versioned AI-generated meal plans |
| 11 | `health_tracking` | Daily aggregates (Steps, Sleep, Activity) |
| 12 | `journals` | Private encrypted daily member notes |
| 13 | `notifications` | In-app and push notification records |

### Extension Tables (Migration 011+)

| # | Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 14 | `body_measurements` | BMI, Body Fat %, Muscle Mass, waist/hip/arm/thigh measurements |
| 15 | `water_logs` | Per-day hydration tracking (ml), goal enforcement |
| 16 | `personal_records` | Exercise-specific PRs (exercise name, weight, reps, date) |
| 17 | `notification_preferences` | Per-user opt-in for each notification category |
| 18 | `equipment_status` | Gym equipment inventory (units, in-use, out-of-service) |
| 19 | `todos` | Role-based task management for trainers and owners |

### AI Agent Tables (Migration 019)

| # | Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 20 | `member_fitness_profiles` | Body metrics, goals, injuries, diet context — input to AI Agent |
| 21 | `ai_generated_plans` | Stores all AI outputs (body analysis, workout, diet, report, PDF URL) |

### Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gym_current_occupancy` | Real-time member count per gym (checked in, not checked out, last 12h) |
| `member_visit_summary` | Aggregated visit stats per member (total, last 30d, last 7d, avg session hours) |

### RLS Strategy

Every query is enforced at the **database level** with `gym_id` isolation. Even if a user guesses another gym's UUID, Supabase RLS returns zero results. No gym can ever access another gym's data.

## 11 — Developer Guide

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.6+ with Dart 3.x
- Supabase account
- Anthropic Claude API key
- Razorpay account (for Indian payments)
- Java JDK 17+ (for Android builds)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your-razorpay-key-id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your-razorpay-secret
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-pk
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-sk
```

### Setup Workflow

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/vijaysinghkadela/Fit_Nexora.git
cd Fit_Nexora
flutter pub get

# 2. Push database schema (Supabase)
supabase login
